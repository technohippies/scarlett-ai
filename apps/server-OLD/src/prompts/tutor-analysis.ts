**Performance Summary:**
- Song: "${songTitle}" by ${artistName}
- Overall Score: ${overallScore}% (Grade: ${grade})
- Lines attempted: ${attemptedLines} out of ${totalLines}
- Lines needing work: ${incorrectLines.length}

**Main Issues:**
${errorExamples}

Provide a brief, encouraging response that will be spoken aloud (like a phone call). In exactly 2-3 sentences:
1. Acknowledge their effort on the song
2. Highlight ONE specific thing they did well (even if score is low)
3. Suggest ONE main area to focus on for improvement

Keep it conversational and warm, like a supportive friend.

Respond in JSON format:
{
  "message": "Your 2-3 sentence spoken feedback here",
  "focusArea": "The main issue to work on",
  "difficulty": "beginner|intermediate|advanced"
}`;
